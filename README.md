### Don't start with this video! Part 1 that shows how to create a landing page on the ESP32 [can be found here](https://bit.ly/Web_Enabled_ESP32_With_OTA) with the code you need too! 😉  

And whilst we're on the subject, Part 3 will be available soon which brings it all together and shows the full (and final) ESP32 webpage. But that's for another time.

**Still here?** OK, let's get some values on screen, whether that be an integer value or a string, both of which I use in my projects. There are, of course, many routes to Rome and I show two of them here. Quick and dirty? Or slick and maintainable? Your choice!  

We'll get a value onto the screen (from a psuedo-variable in our ESP32 code) and discuss two ways on how to do that. Finally we'll consider whether what we're doing, that is putting the HTML code into our C++ code is the best way of doing this - or is there another way we could explore (in part 3 perhaps)? Oops, spoiler alert! Too late!
